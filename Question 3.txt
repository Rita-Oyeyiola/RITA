 The basic workflow for using Git for version control are:


    Initialize Repository: Start by creating a new Git repository or cloning an existing one.


    Work on Files: Make changes to your project's files. These changes can include adding, modifying, or deleting files.


    Stage Changes: Use the git add command to stage the changes you want to include in the next commit.


    Commit Changes: Create a commit using the git commit command. This snapshot captures the staged
                    changes along with a commit message describing what you've done.


    Repeat: Continue making changes, staging, and committing as needed.


    Update Remote: If you're collaborating with others, push your local commits to a remote repository
		 using the git push command.


    Pull Changes: To incorporate changes from others, use git pull to fetch and merge remote changes into 
		your local repository.


    Resolve Conflicts: If there are conflicting changes, you'll need to manually resolve them.


    Branching: You can create branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting
			 the main codebase. Use git branch to manage branches and git checkout to switch between them.


    Merge and Rebase: Merge or rebase your branch's changes into the main branch once they're ready.


    Review History: Use git log to view commit history, and tools like git diff to see the differences between commits.


     Git offers more advanced features and strategies for various scenarios.
